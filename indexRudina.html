                    <h2>How to know a house is right for you: Picking your new home</h2>
                    <p>Buying a home is more than a big financial commitment – it’s also emotional. If you don’t love or
                        at least like your home, the time and money you put into buying it may not feel worth it. It’s
                        also not always easy to know if a home is right for you. Sometimes, you’ll know the moment you
                        see it, but it often takes time and careful consideration to make a good decision.</p>
                    <h3><i>Most important points</i></h3>
                    <ul class="post-ul">
                        <li>Buying a home is a big deal, so you want to ensure you buy a home you’re happy to live in.
                        </li>
                        <li>Make a list of your wants, needs and must-haves, and make sure you know how much you can
                            afford before you start shopping.</li>
                        <li>Take your time to consider each property carefully, but also be ready to act quickly to
                            avoid losing out to another offer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1>Choose a home that is right for you in 6 steps</h1>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Affording the house
                            <ul>
                                <li>Following the 28/36 rule, which says your mortgage should take up no more than 28%
                                    of your gross monthly income and your total monthly debt payments – mortgage payment
                                    included – should total no more than 36% of your gross monthly income.</li>
                                <li>Limiting the amount you borrow for a mortgage to somewhere between two and three
                                    times your annual income.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make A List Of Your Wants, Needs And Must-Haves
                            <ul>
                                <li>Must-haves are absolutely essential. Your agent shouldn’t even show you homes that
                                    don’t check these boxes. Examples include a specific number of bedrooms or a
                                    neighborhood with good schools and that’s close to work.</li>
                                <li>Needs are important, but you may be willing to compromise on one or two for an
                                    affordable property.</li>
                                <li>Wants are, of course, wants. You’d like to find a home with these features, but
                                    you’re willing to accept that you likely won’t get all of them. For example, having
                                    a pool might be nice, but you’re not going to pass on a home without one.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Narrow Down Where You Want To Live
                            <ul>
                                <li>Deciding where you want to live is important because a good location will help your
                                    home’s value grow over time, while even a great home might not appreciate as much in
                                    a less desirable area.</li>
                                <li>A good location can give you more than a higher likelihood that the home’s value
                                    will appreciate; it can mean a tolerable commute, a good school district, and easy
                                    access to restaurants, entertainment and shopping. </li>
                                <li>Finding the right location for your needs will likely make you much happier in the
                                    long run.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Work With A Real Estate Agent
                            <ul>
                                <li>A skilled real estate agent will get to know you and what you want in a home.
                                    They’ll then work to show you properties that fit the criteria you set.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Look For Potential Problems With The House
                            <ul>
                                <li>Research the area. Is the pond behind the house prone to flooding? Is it a safe
                                    area? How far away would you be from the nearest hospital? Go online and figure out
                                    the vital stuff like the area’s safety rating, as well as the fun things like nearby
                                    restaurants and the location of the closest gym.</li>
                                <li>Look at the plumbing. Look under sinks and behind toilets for signs of water damage
                                    or leaks. Be on the lookout for telltale discoloration of ceilings and walls as
                                    well. Check the basement for a mildew smell. </li>
                                <li>Test everything. Once you’ve determined that the house is a real contender, use your
                                    final walk-through to make sure everything works. Flip on all the light switches and
                                    flush the toilets. Turn on the shower. Turn on the tap and taste the water.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Red Flags To Watch For
                            <ul>
                                <li>Problems with flooring or tiling, or shoddy work. Damaged floors and tiles can
                                    indicate a lack of important maintenance. </li>
                                <li>Foundation damage. Small cracks in a home’s foundation, especially if the home is
                                    old, may be nothing to worry about, but large gaps and cracking are signs of major
                                    problems requiring expensive repairs. </li>
                                <li>Poor ventilation. Lack of proper ventilation also increases the risk of mold.</li>
                                <li>Window damage. Damaged windows or windows that don’t look properly installed could
                                    be a sign of poor remodeling work or an early indicator of problems with the
                                    foundation.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <h2>The Top 2 Reasons To Look at Newly Built Homes</h2>
                    <p>Here’s why a new build is worth considering – and how an agent can help you find one that meets
                        your needs and your budget.</p>
                    <img src="blog2.png" alt="family in newly built house">
                    <ol>
                        <li>More Newly Built Homes Are Available Right Now</li>
                        <p>Right now, the number of existing homes for sale is still low. And, if you’re struggling to find something you like because there aren’t that many existing homes for sale, opening up your search to include brand-new homes could really expand your options. </p>
                        <h3 style="color: blue;">Even though existing home sales have been stuck at low levels, newly constructed home sales look to mark one of its best annual performance in 15 years . . . The new home inventory has been consistently rising with homebuilders getting active and making up around 1/3 of total inventory.</h3>
                        <li>Newly Built Homes Are Becoming Less Expensive</li>
                        <p>Still skeptical if a new build is right for you or if they’re even in your budget? The average cost of newly built homes has actually come down from a year ago.</p>
                        <h3><b>Builders are increasingly bringing smaller, more affordable homes to the market, so buyers may find more newly-built homes that fit their budget.</b></h3>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Bottom line</h4>
                    <p>Depending on your needs and budget, a new build might be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for to bring your homebuying vision to life. If you’re interested in a brand-new home, connect with an agent so you can check out what builders in your area are up to.</p>
