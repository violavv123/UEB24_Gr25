        <h4>Define your goals for the project</h4>
        <p>Plan out the layout of the room, the storage spaces you need, and the general look you
            want
            to see. Choose what upgrades you desire and note anything you do not want to be changed.
            Pick out materials that will complement the room and design. Measure the room to be sure
            all
            furniture and appliances you pick out will fit in the space.</p>

        <h4>Make a budget ahead of time</h4>

        <p>Once you have an estimated budget in mind, commit to sticking to it. Once your
            renovations
            begin, it can be easy to get talked into buying more expensive appliances or materials.
            Your
            budget will guide you on what you can and cannot afford throughout your remodel.</p>
    </li>

        <h4>Prepare your home for the remodel</h4>
        <p>One of the most important remodeling tips is to ensure that your home is clear of clutter
            and
            ready for the renovation project to begin. Contractors will not be able to work
            efficiently
            in a room that is dirty or full of personal belongings. In the weeks leading up to your
            remodel, pack up each space and store everything in a separate area or storage unit.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Hire an experienced contractor</h4>

        <p>Try to hire contractors with certifications and experience completing projects like
            yours. If
            possible, check out their “before and after” pictures of past projects. You will need to
            be
            in touch with your contractor throughout the entire remodel, so be sure to find someone
            who
            is easy to talk to and understands your vision for the project.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Stay in touch with your contractor throughout the process</h4>

        <p>By checking in consistently, you can ensure everything is going to plan while also
            staying up
            to date, on time, and hopefully under budget. Being present throughout your remodel will
            allow your contractor to ask any clarifying questions. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Plan for the unexpected</h4>

        <p>When remodeling a home, sudden setbacks can pop up all the time. Flexibility and
            preparation
            for unexpected delays and expenses can keep your project on track. Adding extra time to
            your
            schedule and money to your budget can help you be prepared for whatever obstacles might
            arise and keep stress out of your renovation.</p>
