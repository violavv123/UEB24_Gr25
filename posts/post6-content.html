    <li>
        <h4>Enhance Curb Appeal</h4>

        <p>First impressions matter. Invest in landscaping, repaint your front door, and add
            lighting to
            create a welcoming exterior. A neat, attractive yard can instantly boost your home’s
            appeal.
        </p>
    </li>

        <h4>Update the Kitchen</h4>
        <p>The kitchen is often considered the heart of the home. Simple upgrades like replacing
            outdated appliances, installing new countertops, or painting cabinets can make a big
            difference.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Refresh Bathrooms</h4>

        <p>Modernizing bathrooms is another high-ROI project. Consider updating fixtures, adding a
            new
            vanity, or re-grouting tiles to give the space a fresh look.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Paint and Declutter</h4>

        <p>A fresh coat of paint can do wonders for your home’s interior. Stick to neutral colors
            that
            appeal to a wide range of buyers. Additionally, decluttering and staging your home can
            help
            buyers envision themselves living there.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Invest in Energy Efficiency</h4>

        <p>Energy-efficient upgrades like new windows, insulation, or a smart thermostat can attract
            eco-conscious buyers and reduce utility costs, making your home more appealing.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p> These improvements don’t have to break the bank, but they can significantly increase your home’s
    marketability and selling price. Work with a real estate professional to identify the best
    upgrades for your specific market.</p>
