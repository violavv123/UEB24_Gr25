<h2>How to know a house is right for you: Picking your new home</h2>
<p>Buying a home is more than a big financial commitment – it’s also emotional. If you don’t love or
    at least like your home, the time and money you put into buying it may not feel worth it. It’s
    also not always easy to know if a home is right for you. Sometimes, you’ll know the moment you
    see it, but it often takes time and careful consideration to make a good decision.</p>
<h3><i>Most important points</i></h3>
<ul class="post-ul">
    <li>Buying a home is a big deal, so you want to ensure you buy a home you’re happy to live in.
    </li>
    <li>Make a list of your wants, needs and must-haves, and make sure you know how much you can
        afford before you start shopping.</li>
    <li>Take your time to consider each property carefully, but also be ready to act quickly to
        avoid losing out to another offer.</li>
</ul>

    <li>
        Affording the house
        <ul>
            <li>Following the 28/36 rule, which says your mortgage should take up no more than 28%
                of your gross monthly income and your total monthly debt payments – mortgage payment
                included – should total no more than 36% of your gross monthly income.</li>
            <li>Limiting the amount you borrow for a mortgage to somewhere between two and three
                times your annual income.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Make A List Of Your Wants, Needs And Must-Haves
        <ul>
            <li>Must-haves are absolutely essential. Your agent shouldn’t even show you homes that
                don’t check these boxes. Examples include a specific number of bedrooms or a
                neighborhood with good schools and that’s close to work.</li>
            <li>Needs are important, but you may be willing to compromise on one or two for an
                affordable property.</li>
            <li>Wants are, of course, wants. You’d like to find a home with these features, but
                you’re willing to accept that you likely won’t get all of them. For example, having
                a pool might be nice, but you’re not going to pass on a home without one.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Narrow Down Where You Want To Live
        <ul>
            <li>Deciding where you want to live is important because a good location will help your
                home’s value grow over time, while even a great home might not appreciate as much in
                a less desirable area.</li>
            <li>A good location can give you more than a higher likelihood that the home’s value
                will appreciate; it can mean a tolerable commute, a good school district, and easy
                access to restaurants, entertainment and shopping. </li>
            <li>Finding the right location for your needs will likely make you much happier in the
                long run.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Work With A Real Estate Agent
        <ul>
            <li>A skilled real estate agent will get to know you and what you want in a home.
                They’ll then work to show you properties that fit the criteria you set.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Look For Potential Problems With The House
        <ul>
            <li>Research the area. Is the pond behind the house prone to flooding? Is it a safe
                area? How far away would you be from the nearest hospital? Go online and figure out
                the vital stuff like the area’s safety rating, as well as the fun things like nearby
                restaurants and the location of the closest gym.</li>
            <li>Look at the plumbing. Look under sinks and behind toilets for signs of water damage
                or leaks. Be on the lookout for telltale discoloration of ceilings and walls as
                well. Check the basement for a mildew smell. </li>
            <li>Test everything. Once you’ve determined that the house is a real contender, use your
                final walk-through to make sure everything works. Flip on all the light switches and
                flush the toilets. Turn on the shower. Turn on the tap and taste the water.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Red Flags To Watch For
        <ul>
            <li>Problems with flooring or tiling, or shoddy work. Damaged floors and tiles can
                indicate a lack of important maintenance. </li>
            <li>Foundation damage. Small cracks in a home’s foundation, especially if the home is
                old, may be nothing to worry about, but large gaps and cracking are signs of major
                problems requiring expensive repairs. </li>
            <li>Poor ventilation. Lack of proper ventilation also increases the risk of mold.</li>
            <li>Window damage. Damaged windows or windows that don’t look properly installed could
                be a sign of poor remodeling work or an early indicator of problems with the
                foundation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
